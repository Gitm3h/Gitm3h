- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gitm3h
- 👀 I’m interested in computers and everything digital.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning video game level design using freesource game editing tools available for my all time favorite game that is as old as i am.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the first project i'm working on for which i already have some proof of concept.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My reflexes are so fast, i can catch a fly with surgical precision! (I then release them, because i like to live and let live)
